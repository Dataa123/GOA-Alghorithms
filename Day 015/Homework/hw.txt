3.1 Access

Access means to have access to read or modify an object.

3.2 Alignment

Alignment refers to how data is arranged and accessed in memory. In many programming languages (especially C, C++, and low-level languages), certain types of variables must be stored at memory addresses that are multiples of a specific number of bytes.

3.3 Argument

An argument is the value you pass to a function or macro when you call it.

3.4 Behavior

The external appearance or action of a program â€” what it does when it runs.

3.4.1 implementation-defined Behavior

unspecified behavior where each implementation documents howthe choice is made

3.4.2 locale-specific Behavior

behavior that depends on local conventions of nationality,culture, and language that each implementation documents

3.4.3 undefined Behavior

behavior,upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data, for which this International Standard imposes no requirements

3.4.4 unspecified Behavior

use of an unspecified value, or other behavior where this International Standard provides twoormore possibilities and imposes no further requirements on which is chosen in any instance

3.5 Bit

unit of data storage in the execution environment large enough to hold an object that may have one of two values

3.6 Byte

addressable unit of data storage large enough to hold anymember of the basic character set of the execution environment

3.7 Character

member of a set of elements used for the organization, control, or representation of data

3.7.1 single-byte character

bit representation that fits in a byte

3.7.2 multibyte character

sequence of one or more bytes representing a member of the extended character set of either the source or the execution environment

3.7.3 wide character

value representable by an object of type wchar_t, capable of representing any character in the current locale

3.8 Constraint

restriction, either syntactic or semantic, by which the exposition of language elements is to be interpreted

3.9 Correctly rounded result

representation in the result format that is nearest in value, subject to the current rounding mode, to what the result would be given unlimited range and precision
